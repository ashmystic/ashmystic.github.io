I started writing this piano piece this week so itâ€™s still a work-in-progress and a little rough around the edges. I felt called to share it now because it feels very connected to the Eclipse portal we are in that climaxes with the annular solar eclipse today (Saturday, October 14). Eclipses thin the veil to the spirit realm, and are an opportunity to delve into our personal and collective shadow. That feels especially true with Pluto recently going direct in Capricorn. The theme of this song is celebrating the beauty and achievements of life as it ends, and entering a new sacred chapter after death.
