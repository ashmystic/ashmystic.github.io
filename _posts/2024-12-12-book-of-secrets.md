excerpt: A study of my diorama art project exploring 3 hidden truths about humanity.
---

Book of Secrets is an interactive triptic diorama exploring 3 hidden truths about humanity. They correspond to our past, present, and future.

The book is divided into 3 sections or volumes - one for each truth:

* <a href="#volume-1-left---the-past-anunnaki-stargate">Volume 1 (Left) - The Past: "Anunnaki Stargate"</a>
* <a href="#volume-2-middle---the-present-mirror-of-truth">Volume 2 (Middle) - The Present: "Mirror of Truth"</a>
* <a href="#volume-3-right---the-future-souls-journey">Volume 3 (Right) - The Future: "Soul's Journey"</a>

## Volume 1 (Left) - The Past: "Anunnaki Stargate"
<!-- ## Volume 1 (Left) - The Past: "Anunnaki Stargate" -->

Volume 1 explores the Anunnaki myth origin story. Are we star beings who began inhabiting human bodies that were genetically-engineered by multidimensional entities who we now call gods? Put on the headphones and tap on a destination to visit cosmic sacred sites near and far. Reflect on the poem found on the outer edge.

### Special Features:
* A smartphone hidden behind a foam facade runs <a href="https://github.com/ashmystic/stargate-portal-book-of-secrets" target="_blank"><b>custom interactive Javascript code</b></a> allowing the user to select a destination and see/hear it. The locations include sacred sites connected to the Anunnaki myth, both here on Earth and in the multideminsional universe.

### Materials:
* foam, cardboard, card stock, paper, wire, smartphone, headphones, acrylic paint, colored pencil, gold leaf, craft moss

## Volume 2 (Middle) - The Present: "Mirror of Truth"

Volume 2 breaks through the illusions of the Matrix (modern society). It invites us to peer past the false image by looking at our “true reflection” in a non-reversing mirror. Can you decode the message and really feel it in your mind’s eye? Utilize the power of the crystal towers to re-align with your true self. Reflect on the poem found around the mirror.

### Special Features:
* A non-reversing mirror shows you what you look like to other people. It uses 2 mirrors connected at a 45-degree angle. Unlike a regular mirror, it doesn't reverse text. And when you move in one direction, your reflection appears to go the other way.
* <a href="#infinity-mirror"><b>Infinity mirrors</b></a> on either side reveal crystal + <a href="#orgone-and-orgonite"><b>orgonite</b></a> towers. The left and right towers represent "negative" and "positive" vibration, respectively. "Negative" equates to what you release through grounding and "positive" equates to what you bring in through channeling. Thus they help you become a bridge for the Divine to connect with Earth. The towers are connected to the copper plates on the front via metal wires, allowing you to electrically connect to the energy of the towers. (No current is artificially added; the only current is the passive current generated by the piezoelectric effect of the orgonite).

### Materials:
* foam, cardboard, card stock, paper, mirrors, clear acrylic sheets, window tint film, crystals, orgonite, wire, LED lights, acrylic paint, colored pencil, gold leaf, craft moss

## Volume 3 (Right) - The Future: "Soul’s Journey"

Volume 3 explores the theory of Reincarnation. The portal beckons us to sing our soul home to the spirit realm between lives, ready to integrate a lifetime of experiences and plan a new lifetime of learning and growth. Reflect on the poem found on the outer edge.

### Special Features:
* A portal represents the passage of the soul to the spirit realm after physical death of the body. The inside of the portal includes an <a href="#infinity-mirror"><b>infinity mirror</b></a> with a soul floating/traveling within, representing the multidimensional nature of our soul. On the outside (frame) of the portal are the different stages of life and reincarnation. Above the portal are spirit guides and angels watching over in protection.
* Inside the portal are lights activated by sound. Sound is the fundamental primordial force that existed at the time of Creation. This alludes to your soul as the core essence of who you are.

### Materials:
* foam, cardboard, card stock, paper, mirrors, clear acrylic sheets, window tint film, LED lights, acrylic paint, colored pencil, gold leaf, craft moss

## Definitions

### Infinity Mirror:

An infinity mirror gives the illusion of infinite depth when viewed through. It is made using a regular mirror in the back, with a one-way/two-way mirror on the front, and lights in-between. The one-way/two-way mirror allows a percentage of light through, allowing some light to be reflercted to the mirror in the back and some of the light to reach the viewer. Since some light escapes with each reflection, the reflections get dimmer and dimmer so it appears to fade into the distance.

For this project I made the one-way/two-way mirror by applying window tint film to acrylic sheets. This allowed me to easily cut and make custom shapes. The window tint film can be easily found online or at home improvement/hardware stores. The film I used allows 60% of light to pass through. There are many tutorials online for applying the film to acrylic or glass.

There are a few keys to making an effective infinity mirror illusion:
* Use a good-quality mirror for the back
* An ideal percentage of light for the window tint film to let through is about 60%
* Make sure there is plenty of light in-between the two mirrors. Use many strong LEDs for this. Brighter lights will make more reflections visible, meaning the infinity mirror will appear to be deeper.

### Orgone and Orgonite:

Orgone is a compound discovered/invented by Wilhem Reich in the 1930s.

It consists of natural crystals and conductive metal encased in resin. When it hardens, the resin squeezes the crystals. When crystals are squeezed they emit a special type of energy called piezoelectricity. This energy is said to have cleansing and vitalizing effects on the environment and living beings nearby.
