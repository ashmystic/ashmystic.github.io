Here’s a poem I wrote this Friday as part of my weekly poetry group. The theme was writing about our sense of self-identity. I wrote about my multidimensional nature as a spirit and human.


### "I Am, You Are"

I am a spiritual being having a human experience,<br>
Said Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.<br>
Sometimes I forget I’m spirit.<br>
Sometimes I forget I’m human.

I try to remember this origin,<br>
When the pain feels too much<br>
Or when it feels too meaningless.

Sometimes the remembrance chains me to eternal suffering.<br>
Sometimes it sets me free.

Sometimes I sit in a room full of people<br>
And feel completely alone.<br>
And sometimes,<br>
I see other spirits - glowing and warm -<br>
Like bright burning stars against the jet black sky of a new moon,<br>
Shining light for each other until we have no more to give.
