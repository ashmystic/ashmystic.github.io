Above art: "Eclipse Portal 2024"

I recently made this pen and watercolor illustration in honor of the total solar eclipse occuring April 8 of this year. I had an incredibly profound vortex/portal-like experience attending the last total solar eclipse in America in 2017. It even inspired me to create an oracle deck (check out the story <a href="https://twelvemushrooms.com/docs/learn/about/" target="_blank">here</a>!)

I also wrote a post for the 5-year anniversary of the 2017 eclipse which includes a guided meditation to use for this eclipse too. You can read it <a href="https://ashmystic.com/blog/2022-08-21-great-american-eclipse-5-year-anniversary" target="_blank">here</a>.

The Eclipse Portal painting was commissioned as a contribution to a charity silent auction to benefit a young boy healing from leukemia. The silent auction will be part of an eclipse celebration and viewing event in Chardon, Ohio (near where I live) hosted by the Current Way Wellness Movement.

I also turned this painting into a meditation music video below:

The day-long celebration hosted by the Current Way will be held in a beautiful park pavilion at Claridon Woodlands at will feature a violin invocation, crystal healing bed, juice bar, cosmic channelings, an astrology update, forest bath/hike and bonfire. Other items in the silent auction include a trip to the Grand Cayman Islands, massage package and henna tattoo session. If you're in the area I recommend going! You can also attend some of the activities remotely on Zoom. <a href="https://currentway.simpletix.com" target="_blank">Here</a> is the link to purchase tickets.

Wherever you are for the eclipse, I hope it's a magical one for you!
