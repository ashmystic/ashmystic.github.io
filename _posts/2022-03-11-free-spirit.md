excerpt: Today is Red Rhythmic Moon in the Dreamspell Calendar, which both represents the power of Universal Water/Flow. It inspired me to play this song "The River" by Aurora, which is about releasing emotion.

## Is your spirit free?
### The connection between freedom, structure and the present moment.

🌞🏛 Structure (e.g. routines, plans, commitments, jobs, hierarchy, institutions) represent the gift of the divine masculine: a safe container and safety net to play within.

🌝🌬 Intuition represents the gift of the divine feminine: an inner knowing of the right course of action in any moment.

Structures become bigger and stronger the further out you emanate from the present moment (think: job, insurance, 401k, etc.). But the present moment is where intuition flows and magick happens! It is the state in which our soul finds empowerment and freedom.

To be a free spirit- to flow in the present moment- requires discipline to create and follow our own structures. We must trust the feelings and messages and signs within and around us from moment to moment. We must trust in a new paradigm of being.

When we do this, we become unstoppable bringers of the New Earth 🌍🌈🦋
