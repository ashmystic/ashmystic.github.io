🌚⚡️🌝 On this day 7 years ago - a day after the 2017 Great American Eclipse - I experienced a profound mystical and transcendental experience. I witnessed a very elaborate synchronicity in nature that led to a rapturous transcendental state. It felt like a powerful message from the Divine about the continuation of the soul after death to return home to a spirit realm, and then reincarnate into a new body.

🌳🔯🌳 The synchronicity involved discovering twelve mushrooms growing in an arc between 2 trees. The mushrooms were arranged in such a way that elegantly represented the stages of life and reincarnation. Further study revealed powerful connections to sacred geometry, astrology, the wheel of time, the world tree and the tree of life.

🍄‍🟫🎴🌟I turned this experience into an Oracle card deck. The front sides of the 7 cards represent 7 main stages of the cycle of life: <i>Birth, Growth, Relationships, Aging/Illness, Loss, Death, Tree of Life (visit home to Spirit Realm & then Reincarnation)</i>. The back side of the cards represent 7 incremental States of Consciousness that lead to enlightenment/self-discovery: <i>Presence, Gratitude, Synchronicity, Gnosis, Surrender, Rapture, Spirit</i>.

☯️🎴🐚 The front sides represent different stages or phases we encounter: our entire life, and the life cycle of relationships, projects, jobs, and beliefs. The back sides are independent cards for divining messages, but also connect to the front sides. They represent different positive modes of being that nurture, restore, honor and integrate the medicine of the front sides to help us become One.

🧘‍♀️🌬️💝 The intention of this deck is to help provide context, honor, respect and integration of ALL parts of life: recognizing that what is unpleasant is part of, and helps make way for the pleasant. It is all part of our sou'ls journey and evolution.

🎮👫📱This project is also more than an oracle deck. It is intended to be a community of people uniting around the magick of finding synchronicities and divine messages in nature. Currently under development is an online member portal where you'll be invited to engage with interactive art projects, activities and meditations! Included with each deck is a member card with a unique ID and passcode for you to use once the portal is live.
